It was a different time back in 2009. I was graduating with my bachelor’s degree, double-majoring in psychology and journalism. I’d done my time practicing the basics of journalism. I interviewed peers for profile stories in the classroom. I interviewed strangers for community news stories while writing for the student newspaper. I interviewed subject matter experts to help me with fact-checking. I took notes in a little notebook labeled "PROFESSIONAL REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK." I sure felt like a PROFESSIONAL REPORTER.  

But I was done with all of that. I was graduating, and now it was time to - 

To what? Find a job at a media company? Find a town offering jobs for their print newspaper?

At that time, I had two things not working in my favor:
- The economy and a lack of available jobs
- My own narrow view of what I could do with my journalism education

The economy is not in my control, so there was no sense in worrying about it. What is in my control is how I choose to tell my story and position my skill set. News media jobs were hard to get, and I honestly didn't know if I wanted to be the local community muckraker.  

It was only when I realized the _underlying skill_ of journalism that I was able to position myself as a successful candidate for a variety of jobs, go into interviews with confidence, and eventually land a role at a tech startup. 

The underlying skill is not being a good writer or editor. It's being a **detective**. 

I've used my detective skills throughout my career, but these skills have been especially helpful in tech writing roles.

Here are the key detective skills I learned in journalism that I use daily in technical writing:

1. Research skills: Technical writers and journalists rely heavily on research skills to gather information and piece together details. Technical writers have to thoroughly investigate and understand the subject matter they're writing about, just like journalists gather accurate information to report on news stories. For both roles, it involves digging into the topic, interviewing experts, verifying accuracy, and sometimes getting hands-on experience to gather the necessary information.

2. Interview skills: Journalists often conduct interviews to learn from experts and get quotes for their stories. Technical writers also need to meet with subject matter experts to gather insights and details for accurate documentation. Both professions require strong interviewing skills to ask the right questions, listen actively, and anticipate what information the audience will need to know. 

3. Attention to detail: Technical documentation needs to be accurate and precise, leaving no room for errors or ambiguity. While an occasional mistake is understandable, users might lose trust in your company if they're frequently coming across inaccurate or outdated instructions. Similarly, journalists need to make sure their stories are accurate in order to maintain credibility and trust with the public.

4. Communication skills: Technical writers need strong communication skills to convey complex concepts clearly and effectively. They need to understand the persona of their customer base and cater their writing to the technical level of the persona. Journalists often need to take complex information from an interview and communicate it for a wide audience to understand. In other words, both professions require the ability to distill technical jargon and complex concepts into content that aligns with the knowledge and skill level of their audience.

5. Constant learning: Just as journalists need to stay up to date on the latest trends and stories, technical writers are continously learning about new technologies and developments in their field. Even when you work at the same tech company for several years, you will find yourself learning constantly as the features of the product change and evolve. Both roles involve lifelong learning and a willingness to adapt to new information and challenges.


In conclusion, the "detective" side of journalism -- research, interview skills, attention to detail, communication skills, and constant learning -- is broadly applicable to many different roles, but especially relevant to technical writing. Embracing the principles of journalism can enhance the quality and impact of your technical writing, making it more effective and valuable to your readers. 

Once you've mastered these detective skills, you can move on to the other things that technical writers generally spend a lot of time on, such as arguing about oxford commas.
